            The three readings for this week, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Hackers Profiled — Who Are They and What Are
Their Motivations?”</span></b>, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Issues of Implied Trust in Ethical Hacking”</span></b>, and <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“The Risk Propensity
and Rationality of Computer Hackers”</span></b>, explain the concept behind hackers and their different
levels, motives, and their origins by comparing them with our current stereotypical view of them,
and how they have evolved over time to pose a serious threat to organisations and people.
<br><br>
The first article <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Hackers Profiled — Who Are They and What Are Their Motivations?”</span></b>,
broadly classifies the cybercriminals into three main types i.e. Script Kiddies, Hackers, and
Crackers. Script Kiddies are curiosity-driven teenagers or beginners who pose a lesser threat to
highly secure infrastructures due to their limited skills, experience, capabilities, and resources.
However, due to the availability of very powerful tools on the internet to perform attacks
nowadays, they can be dangerous at times if misdirected. With gradual experience and guidance,
they can progress to the second level called ‘hackers’. Due to their extensive knowledge of
programming languages and the inner workings of the internet, they have the capability to write
their own exploits and scripts, and in turn perform more sophisticated attacks. They are also
purely curiosity-driven and like to challenge themselves to penetrate a system to see what lies
behind. Crackers are just hackers (have similar capabilities), but are purely malicious and hack
for personal or monetary gains or to spread a particular political agenda. Moreover, the article
also mentions various motivations behind hacking such as curiosity, vandalism, hacktivism,
industrial espionage, extortion and fraud, and information warfare.
<br><br>
The second article, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Issues of Implied Trust in Ethical Hacking”</span></b>, dives deep into the
ethical hacking world and its increasing implementation in the corporate sector. The author
argues whether ‘ethical’ really means ethical? This is because more often, ethical hackers use
unethical means in order to simulate the hacker mindset to gain information about the
organisation they are supposed to attack and find vulnerabilities in the system to report.
Moreover, the author questions whether it is really safe for the ethical hackers to be given full
access to sensitive and confidential parts of the system, in the long term. If so, then how are
ethical hackers supposed to follow the guidelines and not disclose anything, and thus maintain
trust between them and the client. According to the author, “Trust plays an important role
when organizations engage the services of ethical hackers.” (Thomas, 4). Hence, the article goes
over this issue to suggest a solution i.e. code of ethics and conduct. It lists out various
organizations like ACS, CREST, EC-Council, ISACA, ISC2 etc. that give out several kinds of
cybersecurity certifications, which include the study of ethics as well. However, these are
organisation-dependent, and are not uniformly followed. Hence, there is a need for a mandatory
and uniform code of conduct and ethics for cybersecurity professionals around the world.
<br><br>
In the third article, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“The Risk Propensity and Rationality of Computer Hackers”</span></b>, the
author presents a research study done on hackers at one of the largest hacker conventions in
Washington D.C. i.e. ShmooCon in 2008. With the help of a survey, he studied the mindset of
more than hundred hackers present there. “The involvement in hacking activities was measured
in three different categories: (1) technical intrusions, (2) social engineering attacks, and (3)
malware distributions.” (Bachmann, 645). The author came to the conclusion that people with a
hacker mindset are more thoughtful and are likely to delve into challenging tasks willingly, make
quick decisions, try something out many times and not give up easily, and have more risk
appetite than the general public. In the end, the article also raises concern over the challenges and
limitations of combating cybercrimes in today's world. This has reduced the fear among hackers
because “despite the annually increasing number of cybercrimes, only a relatively few high
profile cybercrime cases are presently successfully tried, many of them without swift or severe
punishments.” (Brenner, 2006). Hence, the author suggests that “more effective response by the
criminal justice system is an urgent need—because it would increase the number of convicted
cybercriminals and more importantly, because it would also have a preventive deterrence effect
on the illegal parts of the hacking community.” (Bachmann, 653).
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
I was surprised by this particular statement, <span style="color: #20C20E;">“The average time it takes to detect a breach is
reported to be between 99 and 172 days depending on the region” (Mandiant, 2017)</span>. That’s a lot of time,
according to me. I feel if this is the case, then there’s a severe need to have a system such that the attacks
or breaches are detected in real time or at least in a matter of weeks. This would help in implementing
immediate security measures and prevent another attack during the time the breach is yet to be
discovered. Moreover, the concept of ‘get out of jail free card’ was new to me. According to the article, it
is a written authorization for ethical hackers to conduct an attack into the organization’s systems with
permission and report the vulnerabilities, without getting convicted for doing so.
