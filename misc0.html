        <h3>Short Summary on <span style="color: #20C20E;">Internet Governance</span>.</h3>

        <br><br>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
            The chapters one to three of the book by Laura DeNardis, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Who Runs the Internet? The Global
Multi-stakeholder Model of Internet Governance”</span></b> go into depth explaining the concept behind the
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">‘Multi-stakeholderism’</span></b> and ‘who actually owns or governs the internet in today’s technology dominated
world’. It touches on the various sub-issues of the cyber world such as Privacy, Content Control, and
Human Rights, which the various public and private governing bodies should take into account while
creating norms, rules and regulations for internet stability and freedom. The book compares cyber issues
in terms of four dimensions: depth, breadth, fabric and compliance. Taken together, these chapters bring
into sharp relief the many global tensions over administrative control of the internet and the governance
innovations necessary to keep the internet stable and secure in the midst of rapid technological change
and rising contention.
<br><br>
The book states that <span style="color: #20C20E;">“providing security is a classic function of government” (DeNardis, 8)</span>. With
a rapidly growing population using the internet, and an easy and universal access to technology, “cyber
attacks can come through several vectors, such as humans and hardware supply chains, as well as
malware delivered over the network.” (DeNardis, 7). That is precisely why control over the internet is
more important now than it was decades ago. Taking into account the technical aspects of the internet is
just one of many things to consider. The book supports this by stating, “Naming and numbering is only a
small part of internet governance, and while internet governance is at the heart of cyberspace, it is only a
subset of cyber governance.” (DeNardis, 7). In this “era of big-data”, given the increases in computing
power and storage, governments are trying hard and spending huge amounts of resources to increase their
privacy and security keeping in mind it’s citizens. However, no system is completely safe. Hence,
governments and private-sector IT security organizations should keep on evolving accordingly with
technological developments taking place each second.
<br><br>
The book also delves deeper into the concept of <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">‘Multi-stakeholder governance model’</span></b>, while
also touching upon the ‘Distributed internet Governance Ecosystem’. According to the book,
“Multi-stakeholderism is defined here as two or more classes of actors engaged in a common governance
enterprise concerning issues they regard as public in nature, and characterized by polyarchic authority
relations constituted by procedural rules.” (DeNardis, 20). However, Ideological libertarians proclaim that
“information wants to be free,” portraying the internet as the end of government controls. This shows the
conflicting sides of internet governance. Moreover, trying to develop a treaty for the broad range of
cyberspace as a whole could be counterproductive. That is why the Multi-stakeholder governance model
is considered a better contender due to it’s flexible nature and separation of functional areas, tasks, and
internet governance responsibilities among various governmental or non-profit government-partnered
private organizations such as IANA, IETF, W3C, NTIA, ISPs, network operators, software companies,
registry operators etc. While the <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Distributed internet Governance”</span></b> being an issue-driven approach, this
framework allows for collaboration between various actors and institutions that share their expertise to
solve governance issues at the local and global level. Two related tools are at the centre of this
framework. First, a “living database” (p. 109) facilitates data and information sharing on tried and new
approaches, relevant actors and best practices. Similarly, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“knowledge networks”</span></b> (p. 110) allow experts to
share their expertise and organize around issues within their scope of interest.
<br><br>
Another book by Ben Buchanan I have been reading since the past few days, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“The Cybersecurity
Dilemma: Hacking, Trust, and Fear Between Nations”</span></b> shows the kinds of security dilemmas that nations
go through in cyberspace and how we’re moving from the era of nuclear warfare to the age of
cyberwarfare. This book raises some concerns on cyber espionage considering it is on the rise due to its
quick operational procedures and non-risky nature on human life. Countries don’t consider it illegal as of
now. However, <span style="color: #20C20E;">“a nation’s means of securing itself threatens the security of others and risks escalating
tension” (Buchanan, 2016)</span>. DeNardis’s book as well touches upon this topic slightly.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
There was one aspect of cyber governance that surprised me i.e. <span style="color: #20C20E;">offence is cheaper than defence</span>. I
could think of a few reasons behind it, but this statement made me a bit curious. I was under the
impression that attacking any big corporation or a nation would require more resources and high-level
skills, and hence more money. However, thinking in broad terms, I understood that defense would require
continuous monitoring and upgrades in security with evolving exploits and vulnerabilities in today’s
world. The attackers need to get it correct once in order to penetrate a system, but the defense should be
correct all the time in order to prevent the attacks from being successful.
<br><br>
Moreover, the book also mentioned some authoritarian countries - Russia and China - that have
imposed strict measures on access to the internet. It mentions, “the Chinese government’s growing efforts
to suppress dissidents and control Internet content via the <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“Great Firewall</b>” of China</span>.” (DeNardis, 50-51).
The part about having a separate firewall for the whole country surprised me. I previously knew that
China didn’t allow many websites to be accessed by its people and that they had separate versions of them
that abided by their rules, but I didn’t know that they had a separate firewall in place for the whole
country! That was good to know.
