        <h3>Short Summary on <span style="color: #20C20E;">Cyber Responsibilities</span> and <span style="color: #20C20E;">Strategies</span>.</h3>

        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
            The article by AWS discusses the major responsibility of national governments to
safeguard the internet, precisely cyberspace and its resources from threats and hence protect its
citizens. In today’s increasingly digitized world, everything is interconnected ranging from smart
devices to critical infrastructures that people depend on in day-to-day lives. In this scenario, it
becomes extremely important to have proper centrally-coordinated security measures and
strategies in place to mitigate or prevent threats from occurring. The article mentions the three
pillars of cybersecurity – “people, processes and technology” which are considered the key
components in building an effective national cybersecurity strategy. The article lists out the
various ways through which governments could ensure <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“cyber-hygiene”</span></b> namely, “(1)
Formulation and Implementation of Public Policies, (2) Development of a Collaborative
Response, (3) Creating a Culture of Cybersecurity, (4) Promotion of a Professional and Business
Ecosystem” (AWS, 2018). It emphasizes the importance of coordination among nations and
information sharing about the vulnerabilities and threats among public and private entities as
well as countries. Moreover, a nation’s future depends on its youth. Hence, the article explicitly
mentions the need for innovation and talented people in this sector which can be achieved by
encouraging, educating, and training the youth in cybersecurity focussed fields. The author has
included a chart showing the recommended pathways or programs to follow based on each stage
of education i.e. high school, university, graduate programs, etc.
<br><br>
The second article <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America”</span></b>, is a <span style="color: #20C20E;">“fully
articulated cyber strategy”</span> of the United States with an intention to protect American citizens
from online threats, improve existing cybersecurity practices, and in turn prosper in cyberspace.
The document outlines four pillars of its cyber strategy “to preserve the internet’s long-term
openness, interoperability, security, and reliability” namely, “(1) Protect the American People,
the Homeland, and the American Way of Life, (2) Promote American Prosperity, (3) Preserve
Peace through Strength, (4) Advance American Influence”. These are the main objectives on
which this document is laid out. It mentions that America has been influential and has been
leading in the field of technical innovations and will continue to do so in the years to come. In
this digitally inter-connected world, protecting cyberspace is one of America’s main objectives.
Even more so because “the United States is regularly the victim of malicious cyber activity”
(page 10). This document’s importance is justified by the fact that “the borderless nature of
cybercrime, including state-sponsored and terrorist activites, requires strong international law
enforcement partnerships” (page 11), which the document mentions in detail. Moreover, it has
become increasingly important due to the rising sophistication level of threat actors and cyber
espionage cases, with America being the main target. This document also outlines a number of
important and well-established cyber priorities and mentions that “the administration will
prioritize risk-reduction activities across seven key areas: national security, energy and power,
banking and finance, health and safety, communications, information technology, and
transportation.” (page 8). Hence, moving on to more concrete actions. The document emphasizes
evolving with time and securing and upgrading the systems on which public and private
companies operate.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
I was surprised by the statement that <span style="color: #20C20E;">“most cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure
stem from the exploitation of known vulnerabilities” (National Cyber Strategy, page 9)</span>. Despite
the fact that these are the most important infrastructures on which the country depends and
operates on, they are not secure enough. Anyone with a basic knowledge of exploiting systems
could gain control of these infrastructures which could turn out to be devastating for the country,
if in wrong hands. Hence, governments, as mentioned in the ‘national cyber strategy’, should
prioritize securing “critical infrastructures at greatest risk” (page 8).
