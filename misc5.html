        <h3>Short Summary on the <span style="color: #20C20E;">Mirai Botnet</span> Attack.</h3>

        <br><br>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
            The article <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Understanding the Mirai Botnet”</span></b> by USENIX Security Symposium,
explains and deeply analyzes the Mirai botnet attack on several high-profile companies and
organizations in late 2016. It was one of the largest DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks
of that time and infected nearly 600k devices by scanning and brute forcing login credentials on
victim devices. IoT devices (Internet of Things) and embedded systems were its main targets due
to the presence of various security flaws in them. The article goes over the details of its
propagation mechanism, evolution and its after-impacts.
<br><br>
Mirai is the Japanese word for <span style="color: #20C20E;">‘the future’</span>. According to the article, “Mirai’s reach
extended across borders and legal jurisdictions, and it infected devices with little infrastructure to
effectively apply security patches. This made defending against it a daunting task.” (USENIX,
1094). This indicates that the attack gained its momentum primarily due to the lack of basic
security system in these devices. This is because, as the article mentions, many of these devices
used default passwords and configurations which were easy to exploit by using dictionary
attacks. The Mirai botnet took advantage of the same. There is also a mention of BASHLITE,
which belonged to “a DDoS malware family that infected Linux devices by brute forcing default
credentials.” (USENIX, 1095). The Mirai botnet belonged to the same family, but had greater
features and capabilities. The article states that, “In contrast to BASHLITE, Mirai additionally
employed a fast, stateless scanning module that allowed it to more efficiently identify vulnerable
devices.” (USENIX, 1095).
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
The fact that most surprised me was that “even an unsophisticated dictionary attack
could compromise hundreds of thousands of Internet-connected devices.” (USENIX, 1106) as
was the case with Mirai botnet. This shows how these devices lack even the basic security
infrastructure. Moreover, dictionary attacks can be performed by any novice hacker or teenager
with the help of freely available powerful tools nowadays. This is a huge concern in this totally
technologically dependent world.
<br><br>
Also, another statement mentioned in the article that concerned me was, “Researchers
have found that IoT devices contain vulnerabilities from the firmware level [18, 19] up to the
application level.” (USENIX, 1108). This indicates that there are security flaws present at each
step which increases the chances of a successful attack against them and offers many paths or
ways for the attacker to attack and succeed.
