        <br><br>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
            The three books <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“Cyber Threat Source Descriptions”</b></span>, <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“2019 State of Malware”</b></span>, and <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“A
Taxonomy of Attacks and a Survey of Defence Mechanisms for Semantic Social Engineering
Attacks”</b></span>, mention current trends, related statistics and predictions, and present situations in
today’s threat landscape and their possible mitigation techniques, respectively.
<br><br>
The first book <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“Cyber Threat Source Descriptions”</b></span> talks about the various types of threat
actors that pose a risk to the US Government and its critical infrastructures, categorizing them
into high, medium or low risk based on their capabilities, access to resources and damage extent.
The National cyber warfare programs by National Governments pose the maximum threat in
cyberspace due to their availability to resources, fundings and extensive infrastructures. Others
that comparatively pose relatively lesser risk include Terrorists (due to their lack of skill set in
cyberspace and funding), Industrial Spies and Organized Crime Groups (mainly, profit and
money oriented but access to money as well as cyber skills, so medium level risk), Hacktivists
(political oriented; moderate to highly skilled but relatively lesser access to resources, funding),
and Hackers and its various sub-types (relatively less capable, but still pose a threat to local
businesses and people). The article also shows the GAO (Government Accountability Office)
Threat Table that includes other threat actors i.e. Bot-network operators, Insiders, Phishers,
Spammers, and Spyware/malware authors. If coordinated, these can be equally disruptive as
well!
<br><br>
The second book <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“2019 State of Malware”</b></span> compares, makes predictions, and talks about
the cyber attack trends in 2018 and 2019. It deeply and accurately analyses the various threat
vectors and major incidents in cyberspace in those years based on numbers i.e. statistics and
charts. The article states that “Over the years, we have seen more attacks against businesses,
more detections of malware on their endpoints, and a greater focus on what cybercriminals
consider a more lucrative target.” (Malwarebytes, 6). It also mentions the rise of ransomwares
during 2017 and cites the famous and lucrative ones like SamSam and WannaCry as examples.
After looking at the charts for most used malwares, I came to the conclusion that Trojan always
remained in the top 3. Moreover, the article says that businesses and people in ‘high economy’
western countries are more likely to be targeted by cyber attacks as can be seen in the charts
(Figure 10 and 11), where the US tops the list in both cases, and the UK is not close behind.
Apart from that, there have also been cases of criminals targeting hardware devices, especially
routers and IoT home devices. Attackers have an extra edge here because of outdated devices
(lack of patches) and this scenario is difficult to combat for many security vendors. Hence, users
should be aware of the risks and never take the security of your data or devices for granted.
<br><br>
The third book <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“A Taxonomy of Attacks and a Survey of Defence Mechanisms for
Semantic Social Engineering Attacks”</b></span> explores the concept behind semantic attacks. The article
says that, keeping in mind these attacks, “researchers and engineers should aim to approach for
both current and future semantic attacks by addressing core semantic attack characteristics rather
than particular implementations. That is because a defence system designed for a particular set of
characteristics can be applicable across all attack types that share it, thus making it a more
efficient choice from the perspective of technical development.” (R. Heartfield and G. Loukas,
37:3). The article lists out control stages 1-3 (Orchestration, Exploitation, Execution) and its
several modes and vectors which help in separating and classifying the different attacks uniquely.
Moreover, in this rapidly changing and evolving threat landscape, it is extremely important that
the policies, procedures, rules, and regulations be flexible to “unknown and unforeseen attacks”
(R. Heartfield and G. Loukas, 37:21).
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
The methodology behind <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“sound loggers”</b></span> was surprising to me. I already knew what keyloggers
aimed to do, but didn’t know that there could be programs or tools to record sounds and listen to the
cadence and volume of tapping to determine which keys are struck on a keyboard.
Moreover, I found the concept of <span style="color: #20C20E;"><b>“middleware”</b></span> proxy training portal to be interesting. According
to “2019 State of Malware”, it is “responsible for brokering a connection between the user and Internet
access. Only after users successfully complete a training quiz/test for improving security education and
risk awareness will access to remote resources is permitted.” (R. Heartfield and G. Loukas, 37:22).
