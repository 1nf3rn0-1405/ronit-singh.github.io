        <h3>Short Summary on <span style="color: #20C20E;">Cyber Laws</span> and its relationship with the <span style="color: #20C20E;">Mirai Botnet</span>.</h3>

        <br><br>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
            All the assigned articles relate to attacks that have had a huge impact on a national level.
The first article, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Who is Anna-Senpai, the Mirai Worm Author?”</span></b> by Krebs on Security, dives
deep into the investigation of the actual mastermind behind the Mirai botnet attack. The author
explains the various steps he took and how he connected the dots to eventually lead him to its
creator — <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">Paras Jha</span></b>. His friends considered him a good programmer, but an attention-seeker.
The author says that his first breakthrough came when he linked the account name
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">‘Anna-Senpai’</span></b> on hackforums.net (that released the Mirai source code to the public) to Paras
Jha’s LinkedIn profile based on a similar set of skills. There on, the author went down the rabbit
hole to gather more information and evidence about him via chat messages, his comments on
different forums, his resume etc. The article also mentions that he was a big fan of anime which
inspired him to name his botnet ‘Mirai’ based on his favorite show ‘Mirai Nikki’.
<br><br>
The second article, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“A Guide to Cyber Attribution”</span></b> is about the ways law enforcement
agencies use to come to conclusions and identify the criminals behind major cyber attacks.
According to the article, <span style="color: #20C20E;">“cyber attribution”</span> is “the identification of the actor responsible for a
cyber attack”. The article says that the attackers (especially, nation state actors) “use cyber
operations as a low-cost tool to advance their interests”. Therefore, it’s important to identify the
ones responsible for these attacks and punish them. It mentions three key indicators of attribution
namely, tradecraft, infrastructure, malware, and intent. It also outlines various best practices
for determining attribution such as analysing and identifying through errors made by the creator
unknowingly, timely collaboration, information sharing, and documentation among private
security firms, agencies, victims, analysts, and politicians, and applying rigorous analytic
tradecraft knowledge to observe and uncover data. In the end, the article includes a
representation showing some of the famous cyber attacks and what factors or indicators led to
the conclusion of attributing it to a specific country.
<br><br>
The third article is a newspaper report on a cyber incident that led Microsoft to accuse
Russia behind a cyber attack based on the ways of attribution. It mentioned that the hackers were
supported by or linked to the Kremlin (the Russian government). However, there was not enough
evidence to make such a claim and the Russian government openly denied their involvement.
Moreover, the claims suggest that it was done with the aim to interfere with US elections at that
time. However, due to the lack of evidence, thus explaining the reason behind the title
‘faith-based attribution’, the whole claim was dismissed.
<br><br>
The fourth article, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Grey Zones in the International Law of Cyberspace”</span></b> raises issues
regarding laws concerning cybersecurity and calls the gaps in these laws ‘grey zones’ where
nothing is concrete. According to the article, grey zones are the “areas of law where the
application of traditional principles and rules is unsettled”. Moreover, the article outlines the
following grey zones present today namely, “sovereignty, intervention, the use of force,
self-defense, and international humanitarian law”. It is important that these grey areas be
rectified so as to prevent the exploitation of these by malicious actors due to the ambiguities.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
I was surprised to know that the man behind the Mirai botnet attack was himself a
founder of a security company - <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">ProTraf</span></b>, that helped other companies in mitigating DDoS
attacks. Moreover, the whole sequence of events, chat / forum messages, and interviews and how
the author went on to unpuzzle each piece and connect with the other amazed me.
