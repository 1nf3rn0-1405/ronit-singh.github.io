        <h3>Short Summary on <span style="color: #20C20E;">Brexit Influence</span> by <span style="color: #20C20E;">Twitter Bots</span>.</h3>

        <br><br>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
            The article <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“The Brexit Botnet and User Generated Hyperpartisan News”</span></b>, is based on a
research study done on the usage of botnets, specifically <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">‘Twitter bots’</span></b> that was used heavily to
influence UK’s Brexit decisions. The authors explain the steps and ways they took to figure out
and separate bots from actual users in the dataset to analyse their proportion. They also outline
the problems they encountered recovering and analyzing the deleted tweets and inactive
accounts, which is a common behavior of bots after their goals are accomplished. The paper
presents a histogram graph indicating the maximum activeness of bots during the voting period
as compared to before and after. The report mentions the term ‘sock puppet accounts’, referring
to Twitter accounts. It generally refers to fake accounts created on social media or forums to
spread a particular message or agenda with a main goal of influencing public opinion. This is
exactly what bots are programmed for. The bots in this particular scenario were subdivided into
subnetworks based on their actions or mechanisms – retweeting bot or human generated content,
which according to the report, resulted in <span style="color: #20C20E;">“different retweet cascades”</span>. The authors analyzed the
tweets with the following main hashtags “#voteleave, #voteremain, #votein, #voteout, #leaveeu,
#bremain, #strongerin, #brexit, and #euref” (page 42). As per their final findings, they concluded
that the majority of the tweets generated by botnets inclined towards the leave campaign. Such is
the power of botnets to leverage social media and influence people on a large scale. The authors
also argued that these bots can be repurposed and modified to fit another campaign in the future.

The research paper <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Common-Knowledge Attacks on Democracy”</span></b>, discusses the
relationship between democracy, autocracy, and cybersecurity practices. It states democracy as
an information system and looks at it through an information security point of view. That is to
say, democracy as an information system should be defended and a plan or threat model should
be implemented for an effective defense. Moreover, the paper classifies two types of knowledge
that societies use in their political systems – common political knowledge, referring to a common
and broader opinion among a group of people with regards to the workings of democracy, and
contested political knowledge, referring to a disagreement over a particular thing that is
debatable in nature. Furthermore, the paper argues that both of them should work in conjunction
for the democracy to exist and be stable. However, there exists potential vulnerabilities due to
this distinction in knowledge, which other nation states can take advantage of and exploit. They
are in particular more vulnerable to information attacks, involving fake news spreading
techniques to confuse the public as well as destabilize public confidence. As an instance, Russia
was accused of undermining citizens’ confidence in the 2016 presidential election. Hence,
cybersecurity professionals are encouraged to consider public beliefs as an integral part of
defending a system.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
I was surprised to know that, according to research, political bots <span style="color: #20C20E;">“tweeted at a rate of
seven tweets per minute or 929 tweets in 138 min” (Metaxas & Mustafaraj, 2010)</span>. I believe this
is not a good thing because it would fill the users’ feeds with unnecessary and useless tweets
every minute. Moreover, the fact that “the more engagement with human agents the botnet
generates, the more likely it is to widen cascades beyond the botnet” (page 42) is alarming. This
is a growing issue as the bots are becoming increasingly sophisticated and it’s going to bring
down the value of social media in terms of gaining reliable information.
