        <h3>Short Summary on <span style="color: #20C20E;">Critical Infrastructures</span> and <span style="color: #20C20E;">Stuxnet Incident</span>.</h3>

        <br><br>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify; font-weight: 500;">
            The three readings all focus on the topic of critical infrastructures and their
protection. While the second reading is a research study that gives a more detailed account of a
sophisticated and unusual cyber attack on a critical infrastructure in Iran and its implications.
The third reading considers five key ethical questions in today’s cyber realm (considering
Stuxnet as an example) and answers or explains them in detail.
<br><br>
The first book <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection”</span></b> by James A.
Lewis mentions that cyber security has been gaining attention lately and growing in importance
with regards to critical infrastructure protection. According to the article, “An infrastructure is
judged to be critical because it meets some standard of importance for the national interest—in
that the goods or services it provides are essential to national security, economic vitality and way
of life.” (Lewis, 2006). The article points out that cyber security risks in critical infrastructures
have been overanalyzed and overstated. It states that “critical infrastructures are dependent on
computer networks for their operations. The chief flaw in this reasoning is that while computer
networks are vulnerable to attack, the critical infrastructures they support are not equally
vulnerable.” (Lewis, 2006). “While the dependence on computer networks continues to grow,
many critical functions remain insulated from cyber attack or capable of continuing to operate
even when computer networks are degraded.” (Lewis, 2006). This, apparently, is due to the
redundancy of the internet and its ability to continue working even after an attack. Moreover, the
article mentions the “human factor” that plays a key part in continuing the operations or
functions after an attack. This does not pose a substantial risk to the security of the country and
limits the attack. While in the context of terrorsim, “The complexity of successfully carrying out
a cyber attack against national infrastructures like telecommunications or the electrical grid,
combined with a lower probability of success than a physical attack, may make it unattractive to
terrorists.” (Lewis, 2006). Incidents like this seem to show that risk to critical infrastructures
come primarily from physical attack.
<br><br>
The second reading <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Stuxnet and the Future of Cyber War”</span></b> by James P. Farwell & Rafal
Rohozinski, presents research behind one of the world’s first sophisticated and big-scale cyber
attacks on a national level. It was a worm targeted to disrupt Iran’s nuclear programme. The
article, taking Stuxnet as an example, mentions the advantages of a cyber attack over physical
means. Cyber attack is less costly than military action and poses an extremely less to no life risk
at all to civilians as compared to traditional military means. In fact, it states that “the Stuxnet
program cost was almost certainly less than the cost of a single fighter-bomber.” (Farwell and
Rohozinski). Stuxnet raises various questions regarding the ethics and forces the countries to
advance their own cyber security programmes.
<br><br>
The third reading, <b><span style="color: #20C20E;">“Lessons from Stuxnet and the Realm of Cyber and Nuclear Security:
Implications for Ethics in Cyber Warfare”</span></b> by Caroline Baylon discusses the key questions in
ethics in the cyber realm with main concern on the nuclear sector. It mentions that even though
Stuxnet would have attained its objectives, it would have only “postponed Iran’s ability to
develop nuclear weapons by 2 years, which is not a sizable achievement.” (Baylon). Moreover, by reverse engineering and taking inspiration from the attack, cybercriminals, terrorists, and
criminal organizations have, without a doubt, enhanced their attacking capabilities and
methodologies. The scale of the attack has created awareness and alerted several countries to
improve their cyber capabilities. More and more countries are finding a way to get into the other
nation’s systems. Cyber espionage and planting of logic bombs (in case of conflict) are on the
rise. Thus, Stuxnet seemed to do more harm than good, other than creating awareness.
However, nuclear facilities are still reluctant to give importance to cyber security due to cost
cutting.
<br><br>
Moreover, the open source tools out on the internet for the “good” can be used by hackers
for malicious purposes as well. Hence, restrictions on use and making vulnerabilities public can
help maintain ethics in cyberspace. With increasing cyber attacks, there is a concern for ethics
and it's an extremely important topic to be considered in the future.
<br><br>
<b><span style="color: #20C20E;">What suprised me?</span></b>
<br>
I was surprised to know the concept of <span style="color: #20C20E;">hacking-for-hire companies</span> that work for
governments and private organizations or customers. They operate in the grey area and don’t
really care about ethics. They are money and profit-centric and don’t usually disclose zero-day
vulnerabilities to the public to prevent patches. I was also surprised to know that even the
government intelligence agencies keep zero-day vulnerabilities secret to prevent patches and
maintain their backdoor access for espionage or information gathering purposes. This approach
seems to make the internet less secure, even for the public.
<br><br>
Moreover, planting of cyber weapons by nations, especially logic bombs, during
peacetime to attack in case of a conflict seems surprising and marks a starting point for cyber
warfare.
