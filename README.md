## Personal Portfolio Website (CODING IN PROGRESS)

Hello! Welcome to my repository of my personal website. My intention is to make a website that'll hold all of my information in one place including projects. I wish to give it a hacker-like theme, a minimalistic or modern look which'll be responsive.

### WORKFLOW

Before building anything, I always create a plan of how am I going to approach it. The segments that I need to work on look like this:

- **Plan** — explore idea for the layout
- **Design** — sketch out ideas, work on color scheme and fonts
- **Development** — write the code
- **Publish** — host and get a custom domain name
